## A New Post

First up, the analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, to determine these things, they asked effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis. These were the kinds of questions they asked:

What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job? 
Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?
Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?
What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?
By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?
